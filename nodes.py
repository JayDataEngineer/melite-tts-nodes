# ── ComfyUI progress plumbing ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The native engine_runtime (loaded via ctypes) installs a progress callback
# on the session (IVoiceTaskSession::set_progress_callback) which the C++ model
# code fires at natural milestones: per diffusion step for moss_sfx_v2 (step
# 0/25, step 10/25, …), per pipeline phase for ACE-Step, per text chunk for
# TTS. run_tts_streaming / run_music_streaming forward those REAL callbacks
# verbatim. NO FALLBACK: if no real progress arrives, nothing is emitted
# (2026-08-10 exterminate-the-fallbacks policy — the old time-budget tick
# fabricated totals from wall-clock ceilings ("step 3/900") and emitted
# monotonic float elapsed as the value). ComfyUI's own execution machinery
# stamps running → finished, so a silent node still shows its lifecycle —
# just no fake numbers.
#
# The mechanism is ComfyUI v0.30's ProgressRegistry (comfy_execution/progress).
# update_progress() notifies WebUIProgressHandler, which emits a progress_state
# frame carrying the REGISTRY's prompt_id — so we never have to plumb prompt_id
# ourselves. The sync node FUNCTION runs in the execution task (no
# run_in_executor: execution.py:296 runs f(**inputs) inline under
# CurrentNodeContext), so get_executing_context() on this thread returns our
# node_id. _emit_progress is always called from THIS thread; the worker thread
# only runs the native inference call.

    server's SSE feed. The main thread emits the latest real value each
    ``interval``.

    NO FALLBACK (2026-08-10, design rationale: exterminate all fallbacks):
    if no real progress arrives, nothing is emitted — a silent node stays
    silent. The previous time-budget tick lied: it reported the wall-clock
    ceiling (900 s) as the TOTAL (so the UI showed "step 3/900" — the
    "900 steps" bug) and elapsed monotonic time as the VALUE (the
    ``1.0000807540200185`` float that crashed the client's int progress

    running → finished (execution.py start_progress/finish_progress), so
    the node's lifecycle is never invisible — only fake numbers are gone.
    Native note (2026-08-11): the progress callback fires from the C++
    inference thread inside libaudiocore_native.so — the engine reports
    real per-step / per-phase milestones (e.g. moss_sfx_v2 emits
    step/total at each diffusion step, visible in the logs).
